## RepairBot a.k.a KALL-e (Kuopio Apocalyptic Last Life - Experiment)

## Global Game Jam 2020 Game - Repair theme
## Missing features:
- All sounds aren't added.
- Scrap should be collected from thrash bins (currently player starts with enough scrap).
- More effects and interaction animations.
- Epic ending plus story.

In general we achieved our goals quite nicely - and of course - learn't many new things.
Thank you for everyone involved in Global Game Jam 2020, see you next time!
